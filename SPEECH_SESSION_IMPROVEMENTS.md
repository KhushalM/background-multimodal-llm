# Speech Session-Based Audio Processing Improvements

## Problem Solved

**Root Cause**: The previous implementation processed audio in fixed-time chunks (4 seconds) with overlap, causing multiple fragmented transcriptions for a single speech utterance instead of one complete transcription.

**Example of the Problem**:

- User speaks for 10 seconds: "Hello, I need help with my computer setup"
- Old system: Created 3 overlapping 4-second chunks ‚Üí 3 separate transcriptions: "Hello I need", "need help with my", "with my computer setup"
- **New system**: Creates 1 speech session ‚Üí 1 complete transcription: "Hello, I need help with my computer setup"

## Solution: Speech Session-Based Processing

### Key Concept

Instead of processing audio in **fixed-time chunks**, we now process audio in **speech-based sessions** that correspond to natural speech boundaries.

### How It Works

1. **Speech Session Management**:

   - **Session Start**: When VAD detects speech beginning (`isSpeaking: true`)
   - **Session Accumulation**: All audio during continuous speech is accumulated in one buffer
   - **Session End**: When VAD detects speech ending (`isSpeaking: false`)
   - **Session Processing**: The complete accumulated audio is transcribed as one unit

2. **VAD Integration**:

   - Frontend sends VAD information with every audio chunk
   - Backend uses VAD to determine speech session boundaries
   - Both speaking and non-speaking audio chunks are sent (for proper session management)

3. **Quality Controls**:
   - **Minimum Duration**: Sessions shorter than 0.5s are discarded (filters out noise)
   - **Maximum Duration**: Sessions longer than 30s are force-completed (prevents memory issues)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`backend/models/STT.py`)

#### New Classes

```python
class SpeechSession:
    """Represents a continuous speech session"""
    - session_id: Unique identifier
    - audio_buffer: Accumulated audio data
    - start_timestamp: When speech began
    - duration tracking and conversion methods

class STTConfig:
    # Changed from fixed chunk duration to speech session parameters
    - min_speech_duration: 0.5s (was chunk_duration: 4.0s)
    - max_speech_duration: 30.0s (new safety limit)
```

#### New Methods

```python
def process_audio_with_vad(audio_data, sample_rate, vad_info, timestamp):
    """Process audio with VAD information to manage speech sessions"""
    - Creates new session when speech starts
    - Accumulates audio during speech
    - Completes session when speech ends
    - Returns AudioChunk only when complete session is ready

def _complete_current_session():
    """Complete current speech session and return as AudioChunk"""
    - Validates session duration against minimum threshold
    - Converts accumulated audio to AudioChunk for transcription
    - Resets session state for next speech
```

### Backend WebSocket Handler (`backend/main.py`)

#### Updated Audio Processing

```python
async def handle_audio_data(websocket, message):
    # Extract VAD information from frontend
    vad_info = message.get("vad", {})

    # Use new speech session processing
    audio_chunk = stt_service.process_audio_with_vad(
        audio_data, sample_rate, vad_info, timestamp
    )

    if audio_chunk:
        # Complete speech session ready for transcription
        transcription = await stt_service.transcribe_chunk(audio_chunk)
        # Send complete transcription to client
    else:
        # Speech session still accumulating
        # Send feedback to client about speech detection
```

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

#### Enhanced VAD Data Transmission

```javascript
// Send both speaking AND non-speaking audio with VAD info
wsRef.current.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    type: "audio_data",
    data: audioData,
    sample_rate: 16000,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    vad: {
      isSpeaking: vadResult.isSpeaking, // Critical for session management
      energy: vadResult.energy,
      confidence: vadResult.confidence,
    },
  })
);
```

#### New Response Handling

```javascript
// Handle speech session feedback
if (data.type === "speech_active") {
  setStatusMessage("üé§ Listening... (speech detected)");
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Transcriptions**

- ‚úÖ One complete transcription per speech utterance
- ‚úÖ No more fragmented or overlapping transcriptions
- ‚úÖ Natural speech boundaries respected

### 2. **Better User Experience**

- ‚úÖ Clear feedback when speech is being accumulated
- ‚úÖ Transcription appears after user finishes speaking
- ‚úÖ More natural conversation flow

### 3. **Improved Performance**

- ‚úÖ Reduced API calls (one per speech session vs multiple chunks)
- ‚úÖ Better context for AI processing (complete sentences)
- ‚úÖ Less bandwidth usage for short utterances

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**

- ‚úÖ Filters out very short speech (noise rejection)
- ‚úÖ Prevents memory issues with very long speech
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of interrupted sessions

## Test Results

Our comprehensive test suite validates the implementation:

```
üì° Test 1: Continuous Speech Session
‚úÖ PASS - Single 3-second speech ‚Üí 1 transcription

üì° Test 2: Multiple Speech Sessions
‚úÖ PASS - Two separate speeches ‚Üí 2 transcriptions

üì° Test 3: Short Speech Filtering
‚úÖ PASS - 0.25-second speech ‚Üí 0 transcriptions (filtered)
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- Legacy `add_audio_to_buffer()` method maintained for compatibility
- Existing code will work but with deprecation warnings
- New code should use `process_audio_with_vad()` method

### Configuration Updates

```python
# Old configuration
STTConfig(chunk_duration=4.0)

# New configuration
STTConfig(
    min_speech_duration=0.5,  # Minimum speech to process
    max_speech_duration=30.0  # Maximum to prevent memory issues
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Process audio with VAD information
vad_info = {'isSpeaking': True, 'energy': 0.1, 'confidence': 0.8}
chunk = stt_service.process_audio_with_vad(audio_data, 16000, vad_info, timestamp)

if chunk:
    # Complete speech session ready
    result = await stt_service.transcribe_chunk(chunk)
    print(f"Complete transcription: {result.text}")
```

### WebSocket Integration

```python
# In WebSocket handler
vad_info = message.get("vad", {})
audio_chunk = stt_service.process_audio_with_vad(
    audio_data, sample_rate, vad_info, timestamp
)

if audio_chunk:
    # Send complete transcription
    await send_transcription_result(audio_chunk)
else:
    # Send speech activity feedback
    await send_speech_active_feedback(vad_info)
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Core Implementation** - Complete
2. ‚úÖ **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite passing
3. ‚úÖ **Integration** - WebSocket and frontend updated
4. üîÑ **Production Testing** - Ready for real-world testing
5. ‚è≥ **Performance Monitoring** - Monitor session durations and accuracy

The speech session-based processing fundamentally solves the audio chunking problem by aligning technical processing with natural speech patterns, resulting in much more accurate and user-friendly transcriptions! üéâ
