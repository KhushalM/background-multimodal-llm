# WebSocket Connection and Audio Processing Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Connection Automatically Closing

**Root Cause**: Deprecated ScriptProcessorNode and lack of connection stability mechanisms

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Replaced ScriptProcessorNode with AudioWorklet**: Modern, stable audio processing
- ✅ **Added connection heartbeat**: Prevents timeout-based disconnections
- ✅ **Improved audio constraints**: Better microphone configuration
- ✅ **Enhanced connection state management**: Proper cleanup and error handling
- ✅ **Added fallback mechanism**: Falls back to ScriptProcessorNode if AudioWorklet unavailable

### 2. Multiple Chunks Being Processed for Single Speech

**Root Cause**: Short chunk duration (2s) and large overlap (0.5s) causing multiple transcriptions

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Increased chunk duration**: From 2.0s to 4.0s
- ✅ **Reduced overlap**: From 0.5s to 0.2s
- ✅ **Better audio buffering**: More stable chunk creation

### 3. Audio Feedback (Hearing Own Voice)

**Root Cause**: Audio processing nodes connected to output destination causing feedback loop

**Solutions Implemented**:

- ✅ **Removed audio passthrough**: Disconnected processing nodes from audio destination
- ✅ **Updated AudioWorklet**: Removed unnecessary output processing
- ✅ **Eliminated feedback loop**: Users no longer hear their own voice while speaking

## Files Modified

### Frontend (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

- Replaced deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` with `AudioWorklet`
- Added heartbeat mechanism (30-second intervals)
- Improved audio constraints with echo cancellation and noise suppression
- Better connection state management and cleanup
- Fallback to ScriptProcessorNode if AudioWorklet not supported

### Frontend (`frontend/public/audio-processor.js`) - NEW FILE

- Modern AudioWorklet processor for stable audio processing
- Efficient buffering and energy calculation
- Replaces deprecated ScriptProcessorNode

### Backend (`backend/models/STT.py`)

- Increased `chunk_duration` from 2.0s to 4.0s
- Reduced overlap from 0.5s to 0.2s
- Cleaned up unused imports

### Backend (`backend/main.py`)

- Added heartbeat message handler
- Improved WebSocket connection state checking
- Better error handling for disconnected clients

## Technical Improvements

### Audio Processing Stability

```javascript
// Before: Deprecated and unstable
const processor = audioContext.createScriptProcessor(4096, 1, 1);

// After: Modern and stable
await audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule("/audio-processor.js");
const workletNode = new AudioWorkletNode(audioContext, "audio-processor");
```

### Connection Reliability

```javascript
// Added heartbeat mechanism
setInterval(() => {
  if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "heartbeat", timestamp: Date.now() }));
  }
}, 30000);
```

### Reduced Multiple Transcriptions

```python
# Before: 2s chunks with 0.5s overlap = frequent multiple transcriptions
chunk_duration: float = 2.0
overlap_samples = int(0.5 * sample_rate)

# After: 4s chunks with 0.2s overlap = fewer, more accurate transcriptions
chunk_duration: float = 4.0
overlap_samples = int(0.2 * sample_rate)
```

### Eliminated Audio Feedback

```javascript
// Before: Audio passthrough causing feedback loop
source.connect(workletNode);
workletNode.connect(audioContext.destination); // This caused hearing own voice

// After: Process audio without playback
source.connect(workletNode);
// Removed connection to destination - no more feedback
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test WebSocket stability**:

   - Click "Voice Assistant" button
   - Speak for 3-5 seconds
   - Observe: Should see fewer transcription chunks
   - Leave connection open for 2+ minutes
   - Observe: Connection should remain stable (heartbeat logs)

4. **Test audio processing**:
   - Check browser console for AudioWorklet support
   - If supported: Should use modern AudioWorklet
   - If not supported: Should fallback to ScriptProcessorNode with warning

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fixes

- ❌ Connection drops after 1-2 minutes
- ❌ Multiple transcriptions for single utterance
- ❌ "Cannot call send once close message sent" errors
- ❌ Unstable audio processing
- ❌ Hearing own voice while speaking (audio feedback)

### After Fixes

- ✅ Stable long-duration connections
- ✅ Single transcription per utterance (mostly)
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Modern, stable audio processing
- ✅ Automatic reconnection on failures
- ✅ No audio feedback - users don't hear their own voice

## Browser Compatibility

- **AudioWorklet**: Chrome 66+, Firefox 76+, Safari 14.1+
- **Fallback**: All modern browsers (ScriptProcessorNode)
- **Heartbeat**: All WebSocket-supporting browsers

## Performance Impact

- **Reduced bandwidth**: Fewer duplicate audio chunks
- **Better accuracy**: Longer chunks = better transcription quality
- **Stable connections**: Less reconnection overhead
- **Modern audio processing**: Better performance and reliability
